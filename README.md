# Blackarch OSINT
A quick cheatsheet for OSINT and social tools available on Blackarch.

Find tools here: https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html

Here are some go-to tools when you want to discover social accounts from a name or an email:

    Sherlock
        Focus: Username-based searching.
        Why it’s useful: Quickly checks hundreds of social media platforms to see if a specific username is taken.

    Maigret
        Focus: Username-based searching (similar to Sherlock).
        Why it’s useful: Supports a large list of websites—sometimes more than Sherlock—and is actively maintained.

    WhatsMyName
        Focus: Username enumeration.
        Why it’s useful: Maintained by the OSINT community; covers a very wide range of sites.

    socialscan
        Focus: Checks both email and username availability on popular platforms.
        Why it’s useful: If you only have an email, it can show you whether that email is registered on various social sites.

    holehe
        Focus: Email-based account discovery.
        Why it’s useful: Given an email address, it attempts logins or password resets on different websites to see if the account exists.

    userrecon / userrecon-py / nexfil
        Focus: Username enumeration across many social networks.
        Why they’re useful: All are quick ways to see if a chosen username is in use across multiple sites.

    socialpwned
        Focus: Email-based search on social networks.
        Why it’s useful: Finds emails that have been published on social media—helpful if you already have the target’s email.

Quick Tips

    Start with an email: Tools like holehe or socialscan can tell you if that email is registered on major sites (Twitter, Instagram, etc.).
    Move to username: Once you get a probable username, Sherlock, Maigret, or WhatsMyName can track it across many platforms.
    Check social media: If you know they have a strong presence on Twitter or Instagram, you can also use Twint (for Twitter) or Osintgram (for Instagram) to dig deeper.

This workflow often gives you solid leads on someone’s Twitter, Instagram, GitHub, or other platforms. If the person uses the same handle consistently, these tools will help unearth them quickly.
